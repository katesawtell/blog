          <h2>toddler meals</h2>
          <p>
            so i have a now one year old and its been pretty hard to be creative in comming up with meals for him. 
            i would say im somewhat lazy but also a tiny bit granola so this reflects that
          </p>

        <h2>tj's frozen pumpkin waffles, yogurt w bananas, egg n cheese roll ups</h2>
        <img src="images/meals/waffles.jpeg"/>
        <p>he didnt eat much of the waffles but i think its bc i dont have a toaster so i cooked them in the oven
            so the texture was weird. greek yogurt is always a hit. he still doesnt like eggs
        </p>

        <h2>pancake</h2>
        <img src="images/meals/pancake.jpeg"/>
        <p>this boy does like his pancakes, paired here with greek yogurt and raspberries which he devoured</p>

        <h2>fry guy</h2>
        <img src="images/meals/innout.jpeg"/>
        <p>went to innout when he turned 9 months bc 9 months in n 9 months out (trust me its a common thing to see if you are on
            the parenting side of the internet). anyways he loves fries. Especially at the beggining of eating solids,
            he probably ate too many fries because they were the only thing we ordered that was "kid safe" to eat. 
        </p>

        <h2>gerbers instant meals</h2>
        <img src="images/meals/gerbers.jpeg"/>
        <p>30 seconds in the microwave is so easy. i promise i do cook for him but sometimes theres nothing in the fridge and no inspiration
            so thats when these come in. this is the pasta stars, he has also had one with beef and mashed potatoes but didint like it as much. 
        </p>

        <h3>clean up</h3>
        <p>the first high chair we got was super fancy but such a pain to clean because it was cloth. as he started eating more, it was apparent
            that i needed a better solution so ikea high chair + silicone bibs + suction plates and bowls + wearing just a diaper = better solution</p>
